## Effective JavaScript: Frogger

Here is my submission for the JavaScript arcade game. It greatly imitates the demo and provides character selection, bugs of varying speed, a scoreboard that also tracks lives, and the gem and heart collectables. Rocks will occasionally appear as obstacles. Music and sound is also provided and can be toggled by clicking on the controls. Click the **About this game** button for info on how to play.

This project uses the [Knockout framework](http://knockoutjs.com/).

### Deploying

The site should be able to run straight from the index.html either from the filesystem or a web server.
